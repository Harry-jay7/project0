    <P></P>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
    species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia.Rooster and cock are
    terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
    An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
    primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
    cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler">broilers</a> and for eggs are
    layers.</P>

    <p>
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[9][10]

        Other terms are:

        Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]
        Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        Chick: a young chicken[13]
        Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]
        Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
        Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]
        Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
        immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
        Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
        Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a
        term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as a species were typically
        referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21][page needed][failed verification]

        In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook"
        or "she keeps chooks"); which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently
        hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz.
        the young of any bird.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
        as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used
        throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]

    <h3>Behavior</h3>

    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order,
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]

        Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one credible report exists of a
        young fox killed by hens.[37][38][39] A group of hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered
        their coop.[40] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff up its feathers.[41]
